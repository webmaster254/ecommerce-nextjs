**A fully responsive Modern Full Stack Ecommerce application with Payments functionality using Nextjs and sanity cms**. With Modern design, animations, the ability to add and edit products on the go using a CMS, all advanced cart functionalities, and most importantly the complete integration with Stripe so that you can cover REAL payments. 

What I learned building this application:
- Advanced React Best Practices such as
    - Folder and file structure, hooks and refs
- Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API
- Next.js Best Practices such as
    - File-based routing, Data fetching that allows server-side rendering and static generation which makes your websites incredibly optimized (show getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths, getStaticProps), and  using Next.js as a backend endpoint.
-  Integrate Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
-  Manage the entire content of your app using Sanity. Sanity is the unified content platform that’ll make the making of the entire app possible.
- Through Sanity, you are able to change the store’s homepage and more importantly, the details of all the products in the store, instantly and on the go!
- Sanity allows us to focus on developing the application without having to worry about the content, file storage, and databases.
